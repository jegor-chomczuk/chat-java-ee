# Chat
This chat project was implemented using Java EE, which allows communication between the server and clients via REST calls.

Main chat features:
1. Group channel to allow communication between multiple people (a Main channel is created when the application is launched);
2. Private channels allowing two or more people to chat;
3. File transfer between chat users on a given channel;
4. Saving the history of chats on the server side in a database based on a flat file (when starting the application server, a history.txt file is created);
5. Possibility to view the chat history from the client level (if the user participated in the given channel).
